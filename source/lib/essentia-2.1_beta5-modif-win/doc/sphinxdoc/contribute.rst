Contribute
==========

We are more than happy to collaborate and receive your contributions to Essentia and Gaia projects.

The best practice of submitting your code is by creating pull requests to our github repositories 
(`Essentia`_, `Gaia`_). Make sure your contribution complies with the Developer's Certificate of 
Origin that is provided below. For legal reasons we require sending us a scan of signed `Essentia 
and Gaia Individual Contributor License Agreement <https://github.com/MTG/essentia/raw/master/doc/files/CLA.pdf>`_ 
for contributions larger than 20 lines of code in order to be able to merge such pull requests. 
Following a generally accepted practice, smaller contributions (below 20 lines of code) will be 
accepted without signing the CLA to make the process easier for many collaborators. Please, make 
sure to familiarize with our `coding guidelines <coding_guidelines.html>`_ before submitting your code.

We encourage sharing with us any ideas on how we can improve Essentia and the best way to do this is 
by creating `github issues <https://github.com/MTG/essentia/issues>`_ for bug reports, feature 
requests and improvement ideas.
