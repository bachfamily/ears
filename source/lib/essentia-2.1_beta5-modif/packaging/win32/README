This folder contains all the files necessary to create a win32 platform
installer.


To create the installer, you must have installed NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable
Install System):

    http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download

This file was last tested on NSIS 2.44.


After installing NSIS, you must use the program, makensis.exe, and pass it two
arguments:

    arg 1. /DTHIRDPARTY=<abs path to 3rdparty folder (no trailing slash)>
    arg 2. main.nsi

For example:

    c:\NSIS\makensis.exe /DTHIRDPARTY="c:\essentia-thirdparty" main.nsi

'install_essentia.exe' should then be produced.


Notes:
    - If you don't specify the THIRDPARTY define, the default,
      '..\essentia-thirdparty-msvc2005sp1-32bit', will be used
