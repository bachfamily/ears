Thanks goes to
--------------

- Our QA team, for improving the quality of descriptors (and also being
  alpha(!) testers): Joshua Eichen, Joachim Neumann and Jens Grivolla)

- The CLAM team, and especially Pau Arumi and David Garcia, for
  inspiration, interesting discussions and in particular for Essentia:
  - the typed connections pattern using template classes
  - the multirate buffer and phantom buffer pattern, which are needed
    for the streaming algorithms.
    You can find more about these in this excellent article:
      http://hillside.net/plop/2006/Papers/Library/audioPatterns_20060809.pdf
  - and probably much more

- Our patient beta-testers (and users!)
