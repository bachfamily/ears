v 0.2

*************************
*** IMPORTANT CHANGES ***
*************************

These might break compatibility with older patches

*****VERY IMPORTANT:*****

- the "naming" attribute has been renamed to "alloc". If you have used it explicitly, please change the patch manually. 
If you have used the ! and = shortcuts, as documented, instead, you will be fine! :-)

- the ears.peaks~ has changed profoundly:
 	· now its output has ONE more level of parenthesis because the object is able to automatically iterate over multiple channels
	· the peak threshold is no longer "@thresh" but "@peakampthresh" 
	· the temporal peak analysis no longer needs [ears.trans~], but rather [ears.peaks~ @spectral 0]
  please fix your patches!!!

- ears.specshow~: now autoscale is split into "autoscalemin" (by default off) and "autoscalemax" (by default on)

- ears.split~:	now a relative overlap refers to an evenly subdivided chunk, not to the original one

***********************

		new objects dealing with partial tracking

- ears.onepole~: now supports envelopes

- ears.roll.synthesis~/sampling~: 	
		now if needed different voices can be bounced into different channels
