				Automatic Clock Message
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <o>ears.process~</o> objects manages an internal <o>clock</o>
				to control scheduler-based objects such as
				<o>metro</o> and <o>delay</o>, the playback capabilities
				of <o>bach.roll</o> and <o>bach.score</o>, and more.
				In this way, their timing will be correct with respect to
				the non-realtime operation of the loaded patch,
				rather than the physical time of the outside world.
				The internal clock is synced to the non-realtime signal vector,
				as with "Scheduler in Overdrive" and "Scheduler in Audio Interrupt" both on.<br/>
				If the <o>autoclock</o> attribute is set to 1 (as per the default),
				all the objects that declare a <o>clock</o> message or attribute, including the ones mentioned above,
				will automatically have their clock set by <o>ears.process~</o> before each run of the patch.<br/>
				If <o>autoclock</o> is set to 0, the <o>clock</o> method is not called
				and it is the user's responsibility to pass the clock, whose name can be obtained from <o>ears.processinfo~</o>, to the relevant objects.<br/>
				Notice that there might scheduler-based objects not accepting the clock method (such as <o>mtr</o>, <o>thresh</o> and <o>quickthresh</o> as of Max 8.1.1).
				There is currently no way to use such objects with correct timing inside <o>ears.process~</o>.

				Duration Policy
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>duration</m> attribute controls how the duration of the incoming buffers
				affects the duration of the resulting ones.<br/>
				If the duration policy is set to <m>0</m> (<b>shortest</b>), as per the default,
				the duration of the processed (and therefore resulting) audio
				is the duration of the shortest incoming buffer
				plus the tail. If a list of buffers is passed, to be processed in sequence,
				the processing duration refers to the shortest buffer in each iteration.<br/>
				If the duration policy is set to <m>1</m> (<b>longest</b>),
				the duration of the processed audio
				is the duration of the longest incoming buffer plus the tail.<br/>
				If the duration policy is set to <m>2</m> (<b>fixed</b>),
				the duration of the processed audio is set to the value of the tail,
				regardless of the duration of the incoming buffers.<br/>
				If the loaded patcher has a single buffer inlet,
				the <m>shortest</m> and <m>longest</m> policies are equivalent. If it has no buffer inlets, all three are equivalent
				and the duration will anyway correspond to the value of the <m>tail</m> attribute.<br/>

			<description>
				When set to 1, if a buffer inlet receives a single buffer

				no iterator will be performed, and only the first buffer of each inlet will be processed.
